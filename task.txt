Siber Systems 2nd test task for

You applied for a job in Siber Systems.
Please demonstrate your programming skills 
by writing program as described below.


Task
----
Given:
There are several rectangles with coordinates of top left and bottom 
right corners. These rectangles do not intersect each other.

To do:
You should write a program that generates code of HTML table. Table 
cells must be colored so that visually represent relative size and 
mutual arrangement of the rectangles in the best way when this table is 
loaded in Google Chrome browser.

The table should be as compact as possible.
It is prohibited to use absolute positioning for HTML elements.

Requirements:
- A Kotlin application should be written.
- It should use only standard I/O libraries.
- Input data should be in a file which name is passed to the 
application as a command line parameter.

The result table should have the minimum number of cells and rows, like
you would draw it if you had to do it by hand.
In order to achieve that, merge the maximum number of cells and rows that
you can and compensate with the parameters of height and width.

If you have a square with bounds (0,0); (100, 300) one row and one cell
with width 100 and height 300 should be enough. No need to do 300 cells and 100 rows.
